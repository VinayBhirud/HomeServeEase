Steps for creating "sprint"  (sprint is a time boxed event, which has time frame of 1-4 weeks)
	4. Epic (Is like sub-project in project) in which we have sprint. Epic is under timeline section
	5. after making Epic, create issues (story) and add parent to that story (epic_name).
	6. In story we can make multiple tasks, But we are able to create task only after starting sprint.
	7. In task start creating different sub task.
	8. We can assign work to team members. (reporter is a person who assign that work and assignee is the one who are going to 
		complete that work)
	9. We are able to give weightage also. (Higher the weightage == more important that work)

		3.Done (the work which is completed)
